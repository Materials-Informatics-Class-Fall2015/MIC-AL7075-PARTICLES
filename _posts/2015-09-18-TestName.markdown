## Microstructure Property ##

-Fatigue Indicator Parameters (FIP) are used to quantify damage
 - We will use the Fatemi-Socie FIP: $FIP_F_S=\gamma/2 (1+k(\sigma/\sigma_y ))$
 - An elastic-plastic constitutive model must be defined
 - We are using a linear-elastic model for the stiff particles with: Young’s Modulus of 169 GPa and Poisson Ratio of 0.3
 - Investigating the non-local averaged FIP surrounding the particles
 - Averaging volume of ~5% particle volume will be used
 
## Simulation ##

 - ${m_s^n |s=0,1,…,S-1,n=1,2}$
 - $n=1$ is elastic plastic matrix
 - $n=2$ is linear-elastic particle
 - Our overall goal is to test various biaxiality and strain range conditions
 - Hopefully we can repeat with a Crystal Plasticity model if our initial results are promising
