**Boxplots of MSE and MAE**
Recall for the previous post that we wanted to investigate the differences between 2-point statistics of the microstructure images. This was done for each unique set of microstructures. That is 1 compared to 2,3,4,5,6 and reconstruction, 2 compared to 3,4,5,6, and reconstruction, etc.
Now consider the MSE and MAE comparisons for microstructure 3 to all of its remaining unique comparisons. That is, the image does not contain comparisons to microstructures 1 and 2 as these were previously calculated.

For the boxplot of MSE, it can be seen that error between microstructure 3 and microstructure 4 is so small, that the mean and IQR of the error is essentially zero. Furthermore, while the data is more spread in comparisons to microstructures 5 and 6, there are absolutely no outlying data points with a MSE error greater than 0.0030.
What this information tells us is that for MSE, the 2-point comparisons are extremely accurate on a pixel by pixel comparison scale. 
Next, consider the boxplot for the MAE.

Again, we see that both the mean and IQR for the error between 3 and 4 is close to zero. One key difference in this case is the number of outliers in the comparison to microstructures 5 and 6. However we would be pleased as these outliers are all found below the IQR, indicating that they have smaller error, attesting to the accuracy of the comparisons.
**Microstructures**
In this post there has been a large amount of focus put on the comparison between microstructures 3 and 4. Although this post has sought to quantify the similarity between the two, it is always desirable to view the qualitative similarities in the microstructures. As such, microstructures 3 and 4 are produced below for the reader.
